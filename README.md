# Gemini-Gradio-Chatbot

This is a basic Gradio Chatbot using Gemini API as its LLM with the capability to respond to the most recent texts while taking chat history into consideration. You can use this repo if you haven't figured out how to use Google's Content type from **google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types** that Google's generativeai library uses for a chat instance's history parameter to ensure chatbot can read through previous responses when used with Gradio's chat interface.
